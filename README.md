Introduction
The Library Book Management System is a front-end web application developed using React and Vite as part of the IBM Internship Day-5 task under the Naan Mudhalvan program. The objective of this project is to demonstrate modern front-end development practices by building a clean, responsive, and scalable user interface for managing library book information.

The application allows users to view a collection of books with their respective titles and authors. The project is structured in a way that makes it ready for future backend integration and cloud deployment using platforms such as Netlify. This implementation highlights component-based architecture, efficient build tooling, and professional UI design principles.

Project Objectives
The main objectives of the Library Book Management System are:
•	To design a responsive and user-friendly web interface for library book viewing.
•	To implement a modern front-end application using React + Vite.
•	To understand project structuring, dependency management, and development workflows.
•	To prepare the application for deployment on cloud platforms like Netlify.
•	To create a base application that can be extended with backend CRUD operations in the future.

Technologies Used
	React – Frontend library for building reusable UI components

	Vite – Fast development server and build tool

	HTML – Structure of the web application

	CSS – Styling and responsive design

	Git & GitHub – Version control and source code management

	Netlify – Cloud platform for deployment
 
Frontend Architecture
The frontend of the Library Book Management System was built using React with Vite, ensuring fast development and optimized build performance.
•	The project follows a component-based structure for better reusability and maintainability.
•	Book data is displayed dynamically using React components.
•	CSS is used to create a clean and responsive user interface suitable for different screen sizes.
•	The Vite development server provides instant updates during development.
•	The project structure is prepared for seamless deployment on Netlify.


Application Features
•	Displays a list of library books with book title and author name.
•	Simple and intuitive user interface.
•	Responsive design for desktop and mobile screens.
•	Modern development setup using React + Vite.
•	Deployment-ready configuration for Netlify hosting. Installation and Execution Steps Prerequisites
•	Node.js (version 16 or above)

•	npm package manager

Steps to Run the Project

1.	Clone the GitHub repository:

2.	git clone https://github.com/Likhitha216/IBM-INTERNSHIP-DAY-5-NM.git

3.	Navigate to the project directory:

4.	cd Library_management

5.	Install the required dependencies:

6.	npm install

7.	Start the development server:

8.	npm run dev

9.	Open the browser and visit: http://localhost:5173
 
Deployment

The application is configured for deployment on Netlify with the following settings:
•	Base Directory: frontend
•	Build Command: npm run build
•	Publish Directory: dist
This enables easy hosting and public access to the application.


Future Enhancements

The following improvements can be implemented in future versions:
•	Integration with a backend API for full CRUD operations (Add, Update, Delete books).
•	User authentication and role-based access.
•	Advanced search and filtering of books.
•	Database integration for persistent data storage.


Conclusion
The Library Book Management System successfully demonstrates the implementation of a modern front-end web application using React and Vite. The project meets all the objectives of the IBM Internship Day-5 task by showcasing clean UI design, structured project architecture, and deployment readiness.

This project provides a strong foundation for extending the system into a complete full-stack library management solution and enhances practical knowledge in frontend development and cloud deployment.
